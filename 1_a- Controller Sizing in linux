1- Check the available disk space: Run the command "df -h" to see the amount of disk space available on the machine.

2- Check the available memory: Run the command "free -m" to see the amount of memory available on the machine.

3- Check the CPU utilization: Run the command "top" to see the utilization of the CPU.

4- Check the network bandwidth: Run the command "bmon" to see the network bandwidth utilization.

5- Review the AppDynamics Controller log files for any error or warning messages related to sizing issues.

6- Consider increasing the Controller sizing if you see high utilization of disk space, memory, CPU, or network bandwidth.

also you are able to make more on Controller Sizing on the host: 

# cd /opt/appdynamics/platform/product/controller/bin
# ./controller.sh login-db
> select from_unixtime(ts_min*60), count(distinct(node_id)), count(*) from metricdata_min where ts_min > (select max(ts_min) - 10
from metricdata_min) group by 1 order by 1;

Then determin demo/small/mediam/large and add about 20-30 k for EUM BRUM or Mobile apps icreasement
