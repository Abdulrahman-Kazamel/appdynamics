Controller Sizing:

1- Identify the number of agents: Start by determining the number of agents you need to monitor your applications.
Consider factors such as the number of instances and the size of each instance.

2- Determine the size of your data: Consider the size of your data, including the amount of metric data,
event data, and log data. AppDynamics supports up to 100GB of data per controller.

3- Select the appropriate controller size: 
Based on the number of agents and data size, select the appropriate controller size from the options provided by AppDynamics, 
such as small, medium, and large.

4- Monitor controller performance: Continuously monitor the performance of your controller and adjust the size as needed.
You can use the AppDynamics Dashboards and Reports to view the performance metrics of your controller.
