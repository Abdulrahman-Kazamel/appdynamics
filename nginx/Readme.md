1- Create a new Nginx configuration file:
```
sudo vim /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
```
2- Test the Nginx configuration for syntax errors:
```
sudo nginx -t
```
3- If there are no syntax errors, restart Nginx to apply the changes:
```
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```
4- Verify that Nginx is running correctly:
```
sudo systemctl status nginx
```
5- Test the reverse proxy by sending a request to the proxy server on port 9080.

## Note: 
This configuration assumes that Nginx is installed on the same server as the backend servers, 
and that the backend servers are running on the specified IP addresses and ports.
Before implementing this code, make sure to replace the IP addresses and ports with the correct values for your environment.
