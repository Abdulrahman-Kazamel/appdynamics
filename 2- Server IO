measure maximum write latency for the controller:

1- Identify the mounted path where the AppDynamics controller is installed, e.g. /dev/mapper/centos-root.

2- Run the iostat command to monitor disk I/O performance on the mounted path:
    # nohup iostat -myxd <mount> 5 720 > /tmp/iostat.out 2>/tmp/iostat.err &
    # dh -h ===> <mount> = to check mounted / path
    #nohup iostat -myxd /dev/mapper/centos-root 5 720 > /tmp/iostat.out 2>/tmp/iostat.err &
    
    In this example, the iostat command will run for 720 samples of 5-second intervals, monitoring the mounted path <mount>,
    and saving the output in the file /tmp/iostat.out and error in /tmp/iostat.err. 
    The nohup command is used to run the iostat command in the background, even if the terminal session is closed.
    
3- Monitor the write latency, indicated by the w_await metric, in the output of the iostat command:
    # tail -f /tmp/iostat.err    ====> run this command for 1 hour and keep an eye on w-await
    
    In this example, the tail -f command is used to continuously monitor the /tmp/iostat.err file and show any updates in real-time. 
    The w_await metric indicates the average time (in milliseconds) that it takes for a write operation to complete.
    
4- Compare the w_await metric to the desired maximum write latency of 3ms. If the w_await value is consistently higher than 3ms,
    consider increasing the resources (e.g. disk I/O, memory) of the AppDynamics controller system to improve performance.
    
5- Continuously monitor the disk I/O performance of the AppDynamics controller system to ensure it meets the desired maximum write latency.
